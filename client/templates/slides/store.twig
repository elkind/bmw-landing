            <h2>Travel Store</h2>
            <p>This is a storage and recommendation system of the best travel services and applications. We integrate
                hundreds of local and global services from such giants as Booking and AirBnB to highly specialized
                services and startups into one store. Each product will be shown and recommended according to the topic
                relevance, user-centered evaluation and individual user tracking. We are planning to structure a huge
                market and make a virtual, self-regulating Travel Store based on the blockchain and systemâ€™s user and
                follower participation.</p>
